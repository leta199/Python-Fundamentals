# Python Fundamentals

Learning how to us basic Python functionality and features.  

## HOW IT'S MADE 
Languages used: R verion (4.5.1)    
Environement: RStudio

## METHODS AND TECHNIQUES  
**Module 1**- Focused mostly on basic syntax, arithmetic, concatenation and indexing  
**Module #2**- Focused on compund data types such as tuples, dictionaries and lists  
**Module #3 Part 1**- Focused on conditionas and branching, loops, functions and excpetion handling   
**Module #2 Parts 2**- Focused on types and classes with thier associated attributes and methods

## WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD?  
 Going into the future I want to add the following:  
 1) Utilise the techniques o have learned here to do basic data exploration such as visualisation in matlpotlib.
 2) Utilise a diverse array of packages like pandas, numpy, scikitlearn, seaborn and beautifulsoup.
 3) Eventually create my own linear regression model from scracth to test my mathematical know-how.
